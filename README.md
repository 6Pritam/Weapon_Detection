🚨 Criminal Detection System – Real-Time Weapon Detection & Alerts


📌 Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered Criminal Detection System that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time weapon detection through live video feed. The system is integrated with Flask to provide a web dashboard and uses Twilio API to send instant SMS alerts to authorities with location details and captured footage.

🔑 Key Features

🎥 Live Video Feed with real-time weapon detection

📊 Web Dashboard to monitor detections, alerts, and logs

📍 Location Tracking using IP-based geolocation

📱 SMS Alerts sent to police/authorities with weapon type, confidence score, timestamp, and location

💾 Automatic Footage Storage of detection frames with overlays (weapon, time, location)

⏱️ Smart Alert Cooldown to avoid spamming authorities with multiple alerts

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python, Flask – Backend & Web Server

YOLO (Ultralytics) – Object detection model for weapons

OpenCV, NumPy – Image processing & frame handling

Twilio API – SMS alert system

Requests API – IP-based location detection

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Interactive dashboard frontend

🚀 Outcomes

This system demonstrates how AI, computer vision, and communication APIs can work together to provide a real-time security solution. It can be extended to CCTV/IP cameras for public safety monitoring and crime prevention.
